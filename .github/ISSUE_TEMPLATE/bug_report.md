**Describe the bug**
Here tell us what you thought was meant to happen and then how TaleSpire vomited on itself
I was playing with 4 other friends + 1 watching a stream (and playing with us too). 1 player and myself needed to exit the game, we could not get back in. It was giving us the error code 6DBFE66B-C0F5-4E45-BBE9-6A69B61BA7B7

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Play game with friends
2. Have a person quit the game
3. Have the same person rejoin the game

**Screenshots/Videos/Twitch Clips**
These are worth their weight in gold!

**Additional context**
I doesn't seem to be very consistant. I've left and rejoined before without problems.
